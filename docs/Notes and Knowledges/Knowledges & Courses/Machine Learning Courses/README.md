# Machine Learning

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

# Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Network

Machine Learning deep learning and neural networks are all sub-fields of artificial intelligence. **Neural networks** is a subfield of **machine learning**, and **deep learning** is a sub-field of **neural networks**.

# Deep Learning

The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns.

- “**Deep**” machine learning can use labelled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labelled dataset. Deep learning can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g., text or images), and it can automatically determine the set of ****************features**************** which distinguish different categories of data from one another. **********************This eliminate some of the human intervention required and enables the use of larger data sets.**********************
- ******************Classical****************** or “********non-deep”********, machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the set of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.

# Neural Networks

Also called **Artificial neural networks (ANNs),** they are comprised of node layers, containing an **input layer**, one or more **hidden layers,** and an **output layer.** Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold.

# Reinforcement machine learning

Reinforcement machine learning is a machine learning model that is similar to supervised learning, but the algorithm is not trained using sample data. This model learns as it goes by using trial and error. A sequence of successful outcomes will be reinforced to develop the best recommendation or policy for a given problem.

This course is pretty good:

# Backpropagation (BP)

Backpropagation is a widely used algorithm for training feedforward artificial neural networks. 

ANN use backpropagation as a learning algorithm to compute a gradient descent with respect to weight values for the various inputs. 

Backpropagation is the essence of neural network training. It is the method of fine-tuning the weights of a neural network based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and make the model reliable by increasing its generalisation.
